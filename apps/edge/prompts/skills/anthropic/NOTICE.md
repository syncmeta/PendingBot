# Anthropic Skills — bundled presets

The `*.md` files in this directory are unmodified copies of skill definitions
from the upstream repository:

  https://github.com/anthropics/skills

Specifically, each file is a verbatim copy of the corresponding
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` from that repository. Auxiliary resources
(`scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/`, `LICENSE.txt`, etc.) that ship with each
upstream skill are **not** vendored here — only the `SKILL.md` instruction
file, since PendingBot only injects skill instructions into the LLM system
prompt and does not execute the bundled tooling.

## License

These skills are licensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0. The full
license text is vendored next to this file as `LICENSE.txt`. See also:

  https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0
  https://github.com/anthropics/skills/blob/main/skills/<name>/LICENSE.txt

Note that the rest of this repository is MIT-licensed (see `/LICENSE` at the
repo root); this directory is the one exception.

Copyright © Anthropic, PBC. All rights reserved.

The `description:` field in each SKILL.md frontmatter is shown verbatim in the
PendingBot UI. The `source:` URL added by PendingBot's seeding code (see
`main/src/core/skills/presets.ts`) points to the upstream file.
